# EAS Build Setup Guide

This guide walks you through setting up EAS Build for YiChat, enabling full native features like background push notifications and proper app lifecycle handling.

## üéØ Why EAS Build?

**Expo Go Limitations:**
- ‚ùå No background push notifications
- ‚ùå Limited app lifecycle handling
- ‚ùå Can't properly test production features

**EAS Build Advantages:**
- ‚úÖ Full native features (push notifications, background sync)
- ‚úÖ Production-ready builds
- ‚úÖ Free for development (no paid Apple license needed)
- ‚úÖ Still uses Expo managed workflow (no ejecting)

---

## üìã Prerequisites

1. **Expo Account:**
   ```bash
   # Sign up at https://expo.dev
   # Then login via CLI
   npx expo login
   ```

2. **EAS CLI:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g eas-cli
   eas login
   ```

3. **For iOS Testing:**

   You have several options:

   **Option A: iOS Simulator (Easiest, 100% Free)**
   - ‚úÖ No Apple account needed
   - ‚úÖ No payment required
   - ‚úÖ Use `eas build --local` on Mac
   - ‚ùå Requires Mac computer
   - ‚ùå Cannot test on physical device

   **Option B: Free Apple ID + Physical Device**
   - ‚úÖ Free (no $99/year license needed for development)
   - ‚úÖ Test on real iPhone/iPad
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires Apple Developer account setup:
     1. Go to https://developer.apple.com/
     2. Sign in with your Apple ID
     3. Accept Apple Developer Agreement
     4. This creates your "Personal Team"
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited to your own devices only

   **Option C: Paid Apple Developer Program ($99/year)**
   - Required for App Store submission
   - Can use TestFlight for beta testing
   - Not needed until you're ready to publish

4. **Android:**
   - ‚úÖ No account or payment needed!
   - ‚úÖ Works immediately with EAS Build

---

## üöÄ First-Time Setup

### Step 1: Configure EAS Project

```bash
# In project root
eas init
```

This will:
- Create an Expo project ID
- Link your local project to Expo
- Generate `app.json` extras (if needed)

### Step 2: Download Firebase Configuration Files

**For Android (Required for Push Notifications):**

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project
3. Go to Project Settings ‚Üí Your apps ‚Üí Android app
4. Click "Download google-services.json"
5. Save to project root: `./google-services.json`

**For iOS (Required for Push Notifications):**

1. In Firebase Console, go to iOS app settings
2. Download `GoogleService-Info.plist`
3. Save to project root: `./GoogleService-Info.plist`

**IMPORTANT:** Both files are in `.gitignore` - never commit them!

### Step 3: Upload Firebase Config Files as EAS Environment Variables

Since these files are gitignored, EAS Build won't have access to them during the build. You need to upload them as **EAS environment variables** with type `file`.

**Upload google-services.json (Android):**

```bash
# Upload the file to EAS as an environment variable
eas env:create --scope project --name GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON --type file --value ./google-services.json
```

**Upload GoogleService-Info.plist (iOS):**

```bash
# Upload the file to EAS as an environment variable
eas env:create --scope project --name GOOGLE_SERVICE_INFO_PLIST --type file --value ./GoogleService-Info.plist
```

**Verify environment variables were uploaded:**

```bash
# List all environment variables for your project
eas env:list

# Should show:
# Name: GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON (Type: file)
# Name: GOOGLE_SERVICE_INFO_PLIST (Type: file)
```

**How it works:**
1. You upload the file as an environment variable with type `file`
2. During EAS build, the file is created at a temporary location and `process.env.VARIABLE_NAME` is set to that path
3. Your `app.config.js` reads the path from `process.env.GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON` (or falls back to local file for development)
4. EAS environment variables are **automatically available** - no need to reference them in `eas.json`
5. Build proceeds with the Firebase config
6. After build, the file is discarded (keeps it secure)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:**
- You only need to upload these **once per project**
- Upload happens from your local machine (files must exist locally first)
- If you update the files (e.g., add new Firebase feature), delete and re-upload:
  ```bash
  eas env:delete --scope project --name GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON
  eas env:create --scope project --name GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON --type file --value ./google-services.json
  ```
- Environment variables are **project-scoped** - shared across all builds for this project
- Environment variables are **encrypted** and stored securely on EAS servers
- Note: The old `eas secret:*` commands are deprecated - always use `eas env:*` instead

---

## üî® Building Your First Development Build

**Before building, ensure:**
- ‚úÖ EAS initialized (`eas init`)
- ‚úÖ Firebase config files uploaded as environment variables (see Step 3 above)

### Android (Easiest - No Setup Required)

```bash
# Build development APK
eas build --profile development --platform android

# Wait 5-10 minutes...
# Download APK from link provided
# Install on Android device
```

**Note:** First build is slow (~10-15 min). Subsequent builds are faster (~5-7 min).

**What EAS does automatically:**
1. Creates file from `GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON` environment variable and sets the path in `process.env`
2. Your `app.config.js` reads this path and configures Firebase
3. Runs the build with Firebase config
4. Deletes the file after build (keeps it secure)

### iOS

You have multiple options for iOS development:

#### Option A: iOS Simulator (Mac Only, No Apple Account)

```bash
# Build for iOS Simulator - 100% free, no Apple account needed!
eas build --profile development --platform ios --local

# Requires Mac computer
# After build, open with Simulator app
```

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ No Apple account needed
- ‚úÖ Free
- ‚úÖ Fast iteration

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Mac required
- ‚ùå Can't test on physical device
- ‚ùå Can't test push notifications (needs real device)

#### Option B: Physical Device (Free Apple ID)

**IMPORTANT: One-time Apple Developer setup required**

Before building, set up your free Apple Developer account:

1. **Go to https://developer.apple.com/**
2. **Sign in with your Apple ID**
3. **Click "Account"**
4. **Accept the Apple Developer Agreement** (required!)
5. This creates your "Personal Team" (free)

Then build:

```bash
# Build for physical iOS device
eas build --profile development --platform ios
```

**First time:** EAS will prompt you to:
1. Enter your Apple ID (the one you set up above)
2. Automatically create signing certificates
3. Register your device(s)

**After build completes:**
1. Download IPA from link
2. Install via [Apple Configurator 2](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-configurator-2/id1037126344) (Mac)
3. Or scan QR code on device to install directly

#### iOS Encryption Declaration

**Already configured!** The app includes `ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption: false` in `app.config.js`.

**Why this matters:**
- Apple requires all apps to declare whether they use encryption
- YiChat only uses standard HTTPS/TLS (via Firebase)
- This qualifies for an **exemption** from export compliance documentation
- Setting to `false` means no additional compliance paperwork needed

**If you modify the app to add custom encryption:**
- End-to-end encryption (beyond HTTPS)
- Custom cryptographic algorithms
- Proprietary encryption protocols

Then you must:
1. Change `ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption: true` in `app.config.js`
2. Complete Apple's export compliance documentation
3. Potentially file export compliance with U.S. government

For standard Firebase apps with only HTTPS, `false` is correct.

## üì± Using Development Builds

Once installed, development builds work like Expo Go:

```bash
# Start dev server
npm start

# Development build on your device will auto-connect
# Hot reload works!
# All native features available!
```

**Tips:**
- Keep development build installed on device
- Only rebuild when native dependencies change
- Use Expo Go for quick UI iteration, dev build for feature testing

---

## üîî Push Notifications Setup

### Android

1. **Ensure google-services.json is configured** (done above)

2. **Test push notifications:**
   ```bash
   # In Expo dashboard or Firebase Console
   # Send test notification to your device
   ```

3. **Verify background notifications work:**
   - Force quit app
   - Send notification
   - Should still receive it!

### iOS

1. **Development push notifications work automatically** with development builds

2. **For production APNs:**
   - Need Apple Developer Program ($99/year)
   - Configure in Expo dashboard
   - Upload APNs key from Apple Developer portal

**For development:** Free Apple ID + development build = push notifications work!

## üõ†Ô∏è Common Commands

```bash
# Build development (daily use)
eas build --profile development --platform android
eas build --profile development --platform ios

# Build both platforms
eas build --profile development --platform all

# Build preview (testers)
eas build --profile preview --platform android

# Provides download link when done
```

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Build fails with "You have no team associated with your Apple account"

**This means your Apple Developer account isn't set up yet.**

**Solution:**
1. Go to https://developer.apple.com/
2. Sign in with your Apple ID
3. Click "Account" in the top navigation
4. **Accept the Apple Developer Agreement**
5. Wait a few minutes for Apple to process
6. Try building again with `eas build --platform ios`

**Alternative - Use iOS Simulator instead (no Apple account needed):**
```bash
# If you have a Mac, build for simulator instead
eas build --profile development --platform ios --local
```

### Build fails with "Invalid credentials"

**iOS:**
```bash
# Clear credentials and re-authenticate
eas credentials
# Select "Remove credentials" ‚Üí "All credentials"
# Then rebuild - EAS will re-create them
```

### "Could not find google-services.json"

**If building locally:**
```bash
# Ensure file exists in project root
ls -la google-services.json

# Should show: google-services.json

# Ensure app.config.js references it
cat app.config.js | grep googleServicesFile

# Should show: googleServicesFile: "./google-services.json"
```

**If building with EAS:**
```bash
# Ensure environment variable was uploaded
eas env:list

# Should show GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON

# If missing, upload it:
eas env:create --scope project --name GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON --type file --value ./google-services.json
```

**If you need to update the file:**
```bash
# Delete old environment variable
eas env:delete --scope project --name GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON

# Upload new version
eas env:create --scope project --name GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON --type file --value ./google-services.json
```

### Build succeeds but can't install on device

**Android:**
- Enable "Install from Unknown Sources" in device settings
- Check APK isn't corrupted (re-download)

**iOS:**
- Device must be registered with your Apple ID
- Use Apple Configurator 2 to install
- Or use QR code link from EAS

### Push notifications don't work

**Development builds:**
- Should work automatically with google-services.json (Android)
- Should work automatically with free Apple ID (iOS)

**If still broken:**
```bash
# Verify Firebase configuration
cat .env.local | grep FIREBASE

# Verify notification permissions in app
# Check expo-notifications is configured in app.config.js
cat app.config.js | grep expo-notifications
```

### App won't connect to dev server

```bash
# Ensure both device and computer on same network
# Restart dev server
npm start

# Ensure development build (not preview/production)
# Shake device ‚Üí "Reload"
```

## üìù Summary: Local vs EAS Files

| File | Local Development | EAS Build |
|------|-------------------|-----------|
| `.env.local` | ‚úÖ Used directly | ‚ùå Gitignored (not uploaded) |
| `google-services.json` | ‚úÖ Used directly | ‚ùå Gitignored, use EAS env variable instead |
| `GoogleService-Info.plist` | ‚úÖ Used directly | ‚ùå Gitignored, use EAS env variable instead |
| EAS Environment Variables | ‚ùå Not used | ‚úÖ Created as files during build |

**Key Points:**
- Local files stay local (gitignored for security)
- EAS environment variables (type `file`) provide the same files during cloud builds
- Your `app.config.js` uses `process.env.VARIABLE_NAME || "./local-file.json"` pattern for fallback
- EAS environment variables are **automatically available** during builds - no eas.json configuration needed
- During local development, the fallback path (`"./local-file.json"`) is used
- The old `eas secret:*` commands are deprecated - use `eas env:*` instead
